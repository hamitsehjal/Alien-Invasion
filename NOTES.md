# Learning Log for "Alien Invasion"

## Commands

1. `python -m pip install --user pygame`: 
	- `-m` to run pip as script. But why??
		 - to ensure that we use the correct version of pip associated with the current python version

	- `--user`: to install the pygame package to current user environment so we don't need administrative privilege
